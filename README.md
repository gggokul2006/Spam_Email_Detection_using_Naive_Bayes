# Spam_Email_Detection_using_Naive_Bayes

# 📧 Spam Detection Simulation Dashboard

This project is a **Flask-based Machine Learning simulation application** for detecting spam messages.
It simulates how a real-world spam filtering system works using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Supervised Machine Learning**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Spam emails are a common problem in digital communication.  
This project uses **Multinomial Naive Bayes** along with **TF-IDF vectorization** to classify messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

The system is implemented as a **dark-theme interactive web dashboard** where:
- The model is trained using a dataset
- Performance metrics are visualized live
- Users can test messages in real time
